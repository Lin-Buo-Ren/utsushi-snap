## Installation
([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

**NOTE:** Currently due to missing device-specific files, most Epson scanners are likely not going to work with only this snap.  Refer the following section for device-specific hacks.

### In Terminal
    # Install Snap #
    sudo snap install --channel=beta utsushi
    #sudo snap install utsushi
    
    # Connect the Snap to Required Interfaces #
    ## hardware-observe: For reading information of the scanner ##
    sudo snap connect utsushi:hardware-observe
    
    ## raw-usb: For write access to USB scanner devices
    sudo snap connect utsushi:raw-usb
    
    # Connect the Snap to Optional Interfaces #
    ## removable-media: For saving scanned files to /media/* and /run/media/* ##
    sudo snap connect utsushi:removable-media

### The Graphical Way
Browse <https://snapcraft.io/utsushi> and follow the instructions.

### Hack for Epson Perfection V39
Currently regular snap installation is not possible, you have to use the `snap try` feature to install the snap directly from the built /prime folder so you can add missing non-free plugin files into it.  You may aquire these files from the `imagescan-plugin-gt-s650` plugin package [from Epson](http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/?OSC=LX).

1. Create `prime/libexec/utsushi/esci-gt-s650` symbolic link that points to `esci-interpreter` in the same directory
2. Copy the `libcnx-esci-gt-s650.so*` files from the plugin package to `prime/lib/utsushi`
3. `/usr/share/utsushi/esfw010c.bin` scanner firmware file must be available in your system

## What is Working
* `utsushi list` to list supported scanners
* Preview (requires additonal hack for device-specific files for Perfection V39)
* Scan to image (requires additonal hack for device-specific files for Perfection V39)

## What is NOT Working...yet 
* Make the snap works with Perfection V39(and possibly many others) without additional hacking
